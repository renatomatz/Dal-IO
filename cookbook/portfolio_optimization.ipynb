We can also instanciate the objects to be solely used within the `PipeLine`, though you will not have access to them later on. For that reason, we instanciate `time_conf` outside of the `PipeLine` and then place it in ther; this will allow us to control the date selection from any point of the analysis. Thing of this piece as a sort of _remote control_ for date selection.\n",

One could just as well use `lambda x: (x[0] - x[-1])/x[0]` inside of the `Period` pipe to calculate the different between the first and last prices of the year. Both of these are understandable, yet they have different computations and slightly different results."
